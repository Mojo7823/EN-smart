# Knowledge Base & Attachment System Implementation

This document outlines the comprehensive solution implemented to fix the chatbot attachment functionality and add a persistent knowledge base system.

## Problems Solved

### 1. **LLM Forgets Attachments After One Message**
- **Issue**: The LLM would lose context of attached PDFs after the first response
- **Solution**: Enhanced the `flattenContent` method to maintain document context across messages and store documents in a persistent knowledge base

### 2. **No Persistent Knowledge Base**
- **Issue**: No centralized system for managing documents that the AI can reference
- **Solution**: Created a comprehensive `KnowledgeBaseService` with full CRUD operations

### 3. **No Knowledge Base Management Interface**
- **Issue**: No UI for users to manage their uploaded documents
- **Solution**: Built a complete `KnowledgeBaseManagerComponent` with upload, search, edit, and delete functionality

### 4. **No Cascade Delete Functionality**
- **Issue**: When documents were deleted, related chat messages weren't handled
- **Solution**: Implemented cascade delete that removes or updates chat messages when referenced documents are deleted

## New Components & Services

### 1. KnowledgeBaseService (`knowledge-base.service.ts`)
A comprehensive service for managing the knowledge base:

**Features:**
- Document CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Document reference tracking (tracks which chat messages use which documents)
- Search functionality by name, description, and tags
- Statistics reporting
- Cascade delete support

**Key Methods:**
- `getAllDocuments()`: Get all stored documents
- `addDocument()`: Add new document to knowledge base
- `deleteDocument()`: Remove document and clean up references
- `searchDocuments()`: Search by query string
- `getDocumentStats()`: Get usage statistics

### 2. KnowledgeBaseManagerComponent (`knowledge-base-manager/`)
A complete UI for managing the knowledge base:

**Features:**
- Drag & drop PDF upload
- Document search and filtering
- Document viewing with built-in PDF viewer
- Document editing (name, description, tags)
- Visual indicators showing which documents are referenced in chat
- Bulk operations support
- Responsive design

**UI Elements:**
- Statistics dashboard showing document count, total size, and usage
- Upload area with progress indicators
- Search functionality
- Grid view of documents with actions (View, Edit, Download, Delete)
- Cascade delete warnings

### 3. Enhanced Chat Component
The chat component now supports:

**New Features:**
- Reference existing knowledge base documents in conversations
- Visual selection interface for knowledge base documents
- Document chips showing selected documents
- Persistent document context across messages
- Integration with knowledge base for enhanced AI responses

**UI Enhancements:**
- Knowledge base button next to file attachment
- Document selector popup with search and selection
- Selected document chips with remove functionality
- Visual indicators for referenced documents

## Enhanced LLM Integration

### 1. Updated LLMSettingsService
**Changes:**
- Added `documentIds` field to `ChatMessage` interface
- Enhanced `flattenContent()` method to include knowledge base document context
- Modified `sendMessage()` to accept knowledge base document IDs
- Automatic storage of uploaded files in knowledge base
- System messages now include available knowledge base documents

### 2. Persistent Context
**How it works:**
- When a PDF is uploaded via chat, it's automatically stored in the knowledge base
- Users can select existing documents from the knowledge base to reference in new messages
- The LLM receives context about all referenced documents in each conversation
- Document references are tracked and maintained across chat sessions

## User Workflow

### 1. Upload Documents to Knowledge Base
1. Navigate to Dashboard â†’ Knowledge Base
2. Drag & drop or click to upload PDF files
3. Edit document details (name, description, tags)
4. Documents are now available for AI reference

### 2. Use Documents in Chat
1. In the chat interface, click the Knowledge Base button (ðŸ“š)
2. Select documents from the popup selector
3. Selected documents appear as chips below the input
4. Send message - AI will have context of all selected documents
5. Documents remain in context for the entire conversation

### 3. Manage Knowledge Base
1. View statistics on document usage
2. Search and filter documents
3. Edit document metadata
4. Delete documents (with cascade delete warnings)
5. Download documents for offline use

## Technical Implementation Details

### 1. Data Storage
- **Knowledge Base**: Stored in `localStorage` with key `knowledgeBaseDocuments`
- **Document References**: Stored in `localStorage` with key `documentReferences`
- **Chat Sessions**: Enhanced to include `documentIds` field

### 2. Document Reference Tracking
```typescript
interface DocumentReference {
  documentId: string;
  messageIndex: number;
  sessionId: string;
}
```

### 3. Cascade Delete Logic
When a document is deleted:
1. Find all chat messages that reference the document
2. Group references by chat session
3. Remove affected messages from current session
4. Clean up all document references
5. Update storage

### 4. Enhanced AI Context
The AI now receives:
- List of available knowledge base documents in system message
- Referenced document names in user messages
- Persistent context about documents throughout conversations

## Key Benefits

1. **Persistent Document Memory**: AI remembers all documents across conversations
2. **Centralized Management**: Single interface for all document operations
3. **Smart References**: Visual tracking of document usage in chat
4. **Data Integrity**: Cascade delete prevents orphaned references
5. **Enhanced UX**: Intuitive document selection and management
6. **Scalable**: Built to handle multiple documents and search functionality

## Usage Examples

### 1. Upload and Reference a Security Policy
1. Upload "CompanySecurityPolicy.pdf" via Knowledge Base Manager
2. In chat, click KB button and select the policy document
3. Ask: "What are our password requirements?"
4. AI responds with context from the policy document
5. Continue conversation - AI retains policy context

### 2. Manage Multiple Documents

### 3. Clean Up Outdated Documents
1. View which documents are actively referenced in chat
2. Delete outdated documents with cascade delete warnings
3. System automatically cleans up affected chat messages
4. Knowledge base remains clean and current

This implementation provides a robust, user-friendly solution for document management and AI-assisted analysis with persistent context and intelligent reference tracking.
